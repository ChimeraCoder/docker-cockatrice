SSH into the container as user `planeswalker`, with X forwarding enabled

````sh
$ DOCKER_IP=$(docker inspect <container--id> | grep IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4) ssh -XC planeswalker@$DOCKER_IP cockatrice

````


Cockatrice is compiled from scratch, as the .deb file currently points to broken dependencies on testing.
