# Cockatrice

This provides a Docker container for running [Cockatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice). Cockatrice is 'an open-source multiplatform software for playing card games, such as Magic: The Gathering, over a network'.

````sh
$ docker run --rm -t --name cockatrice -v ~/.local/share/data/Cockatrice:/home/planeswalker/.local/share/data/Cockatrice <image-id>
````


SSH into the container as user `planeswalker`, with X forwarding enabled

````sh
$ DOCKER_IP=$(docker inspect cockatrice | grep IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4); ssh -XC planeswalker@$DOCKER_IP cockatrice
````


Cockatrice is compiled from scratch, as the .deb file currently points to broken dependencies on testing.


#### Cards

Cockatrice does not come with card files (`cards.xml`) included. If the data directory does not already have a `cards.xml`, it will attempt to download one from the URL provided in the `$CARDS_URL` environment variable (if defined). This varible is optional if the card files are already present.
